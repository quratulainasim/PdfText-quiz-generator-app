      "question": "Explain the purpose of a `.pyc` file in Python and where it is typically stored.",
      "answer": "A `.pyc` file is a Python Compiled File that contains bytecode. When a Python file is imported, Python compiles the code into bytecode and saves it in a `.pyc` file. These files are automatically saved inside the `__pycache__` folder. Their purpose is to speed up subsequent loads of the module as the compilation step is skipped."

      "question": "Describe what 'Dynamically-Typed' means for Python variables and how 'Type Hinting' complements this feature.",
      "answer": "Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning the type of a variable is decided at runtime, not at the time of declaration. A variable can hold different types of values during its lifetime (e.g., an integer then a string).\nType Hinting, introduced in Python 3.5+, is an optional feature that allows developers to indicate the expected data types for variables and function parameters/return values. It doesn't enforce types at runtime but helps improve code readability, enables better static analysis by tools (like linters and IDEs), and serves as documentation for the code."
